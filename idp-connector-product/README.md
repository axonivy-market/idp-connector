# AxonIvy IDP Connector

Axon Ivy IDP is an Intelligent Document Processing solution that automates the extraction, classification, and analysis of unstructured data. It streamlines document-intensive processes such as invoice management, claims processing, and customer onboarding using AI-powered OCR, handwriting text recognition (HTR), and machine learning algorithms to increase the accuracy and efficiency in data management. This connector:

* gives you access to the Axon Ivy Ivy's capabilities: pre processing, classification and data extraction.
* has a built-in validation of processing results.
* minimizes your integration effort with a standalone UI component.
* is based on REST web service, Axon Ivy UI Component and SubCallable process technologies.

## Setup

Before any interaction between the Axon Ivy Engine and the IDP services can take place, the following steps must be followed:

1. Get a working Axon Ivy IDP `API Key` by contacting support@axonivy.com - this is required to call the REST API services.
2. Override the global variable for `apiKeySecret` in the demo project as shown in the example below.
   
   ```
   Variables:
     idpConnector:
      # The proxy server URL
      apiProxyUrl: 'https://idp.api.axonivy.com'
      # API Key for "IDP Document Capturing API"
      apiKeySecret: ''
   ```
   
   When you use IDP via another proxy server, you need to set `apiProxyUrl`.
   Run `workflows.ivp` of the IDPDemo demo process to test your setup.
