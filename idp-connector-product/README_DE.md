# Axon Ivy IDP Connector

Axon Ivy IDP is an Intelligent Document Processing solution that automates the
extraction, classification, and analysis of unstructured data. It streamlines
document-intensive processes such as invoice management, claims processing, and
customer onboarding using AI-powered OCR, handwriting text recognition (HTR),
and machine learning algorithms to increase the accuracy and efficiency in data
management. This connector:

* gives you access to the Axon Ivy's capabilities: pre processing,
  classification and data extraction.
* has a built-in validation of processing results.
* minimizes your integration effort with a standalone UI component.
* is based on REST web service, Axon Ivy UI Component and SubCallable process
  technologies.

## Setup

Before any interaction between the Axon Ivy Engine and the IDP services can take
place, the following steps must be followed:

1. Get a working Axon Ivy IDP `API Key` by contacting support@axonivy.com - this
   is required to call the REST API services.
2. Override the global variable for `apiKeySecret` in the demo project as shown
   in the example below.

```
@variables.yaml@
```
